# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
I'm an experienced Systems Administrator with many years packaging and deploying client software, and administering Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and upgrading our company to the latest version, 2012 SP1. 
Now, in addition to administering SharePoint for our local site, I'm having lots of fun as an Applications Developer and learning how to program.
I've started with .NET, web-based apps, and JavaScript and learning how to style HTML pages with CSS. Super fun!
